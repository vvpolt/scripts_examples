# scripts_examples

There are five scripts which represent different types of tasks and coding solutions for them.
The first one is "dissertation_script" - the one I created for my dissertation. It cleans and restructures the data I was working with on the regional elections and party donors. The dataset was very poorly structured so it needed a lot of shaping, yet this script is very straightforward and not too complicated.

The second script is "parcer EGAP" and the third one is "parcer RCT". The both were used for one of the research projects I participated in and were aimed at parcing data about experimental studies conducted by researchers, so I needed to scrape the data and then clean it. Both parts are in the scripts.

The fourth script is "corruption risks in Italy: visuals" and the fifth one is "maps for corruption risks in public procurement". Both of them are representing the visualization techniques I used to present territorial corruption risks for various countries (the Italian one contains variety of techniques besides maps). 

Unfortunately, I cannot provide the datasets for scripts 1, 4 and 5 as they are not in the open access, but I can extract the anonymized sample by request. All of these scripts were developed solely by me, no other authors involved.
